So this is about Strongly Connected Components in a graph.

In SCC of a graph, every node is reachable from every other
node. In case a graph is SCC then above rule is adhered by
the whole graph. While in case of SCC in a graph, all nodes
within one such component is reachable from another node in
that component only.
 
It is important to observe that a node cannot be in multiple
SCC of a graph. I have proof by contradiction. Lets suppose
we have a node n which is part of c1 and c2, both. In that 
case all nodes in c1 can reach n and all nodes in c2 can 
reach n. But as that is possible, all nodes in c1 can reach
all nodes in c2 and same is the case for c2 to c1. Which
means c1 and c2 are same ( c1 U c2 ). Hence, n does not belong
to both c1 and c2, but c1 U c2.
